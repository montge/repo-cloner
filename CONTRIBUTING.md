## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher (3.10, 3.11, 3.12 supported)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for integration tests)
- Git 2.30+
- Git LFS (optional, for LFS tests)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/montge/repo-cloner.git
cd repo-cloner
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install development dependencies**
```bash
make install-dev
# Or manually:
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks**
```bash
make pre-commit
# Or manually:
pre-commit install
```

5. **Verify setup**
```bash
# Run unit tests (fast, no Docker)
make test-unit

# Start Docker infrastructure
make docker-up

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Stop Docker
make docker-down
```

## TDD Workflow

We follow strict TDD: **Write tests FIRST, then implement features**.

### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **ðŸ”´ Red**: Write a failing test
2. **ðŸŸ¢ Green**: Write minimum code to make test pass
3. **ðŸ”µ Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### Example TDD Workflow

**Feature**: Implement `clone_mirror()` function

#### Step 1: Write Failing Test (Red ðŸ”´)

```python
# tests/unit/test_git_client.py
import pytest
from repo_cloner.git_client import GitClient

def test_clone_mirror_creates_local_repo():
    """Test that clone_mirror creates a local repository."""
    client = GitClient()

    result = client.clone_mirror(
        source_url="https://github.com/test/repo.git",
        local_path="/tmp/test-repo"
    )

    assert result.success is True
    assert result.local_path == "/tmp/test-repo"
    assert result.branches_count > 0
```

Run test: `pytest tests/unit/test_git_client.py::test_clone_mirror_creates_local_repo -v`

**Expected**: Test fails (ðŸ”´ Red) because `clone_mirror()` doesn't exist.

#### Step 2: Implement Minimum Code (Green ðŸŸ¢)

```python
# src/repo_cloner/git_client.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class CloneResult:
    success: bool
    local_path: str
    branches_count: int

class GitClient:
    def clone_mirror(self, source_url: str, local_path: str) -> CloneResult:
        # Minimum implementation to pass test
        import git
        repo = git.Repo.clone_from(source_url, local_path, mirror=True)
        branches = list(repo.branches)

        return CloneResult(
            success=True,
            local_path=local_path,
            branches_count=len(branches)
        )
```

Run test: `pytest tests/unit/test_git_client.py::test_clone_mirror_creates_local_repo -v`

**Expected**: Test passes (ðŸŸ¢ Green).

#### Step 3: Refactor (Blue ðŸ”µ)

```python
# src/repo_cloner/git_client.py
from dataclasses import dataclass
from pathlib import Path
import git

@dataclass
class CloneResult:
    success: bool
    local_path: str
    branches_count: int
    error_message: str = ""

class GitClient:
    def clone_mirror(self, source_url: str, local_path: str) -> CloneResult:
        """
        Clone a Git repository as a mirror.

        Args:
            source_url: URL of the source repository
            local_path: Local path for the cloned repository

        Returns:
            CloneResult with success status and metadata
        """
        try:
            Path(local_path).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
            repo = git.Repo.clone_from(source_url, local_path, mirror=True)
            branches = list(repo.branches)

            return CloneResult(
                success=True,
                local_path=local_path,
                branches_count=len(branches)
            )
        except git.GitCommandError as e:
            return CloneResult(
                success=False,
                local_path=local_path,
                branches_count=0,
                error_message=str(e)
            )
```

Run tests again: All tests should still pass (ðŸŸ¢ Green).

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

```
     /\
    /  \   E2E Tests (few, critical paths)
   /____\
  /      \  Integration Tests (moderate, use Docker)
 /________\
/__________\ Unit Tests (many, fast)
```

### Test Types

#### Unit Tests (70% of tests)
- **Fast**: <1 second each
- **No external dependencies**: Mock all I/O
- **Located**: `tests/unit/`
- **Run with**: `make test-unit`

```python
# tests/unit/test_config.py
import pytest
from repo_cloner.config import ConfigManager

def test_config_loads_from_yaml(tmp_path):
    """Unit test - no external dependencies."""
    config_file = tmp_path / "config.yml"
    config_file.write_text("""
    gitlab:
      url: https://gitlab.com
      token: test-token
    """)

    config = ConfigManager.load(config_file)
    assert config.gitlab.url == "https://gitlab.com"
    assert config.gitlab.token == "test-token"
```

#### Integration Tests (25% of tests)
- **Medium speed**: Use real Docker services
- **External dependencies**: LocalStack, Azurite, MinIO
- **Located**: `tests/integration/`
- **Run with**: `make test-integration`

```python
# tests/integration/test_s3_storage.py
import pytest
from repo_cloner.storage import S3Storage

@pytest.mark.integration
@pytest.mark.s3
def test_s3_upload_and_download(localstack_s3):
    """Integration test - uses LocalStack Docker container."""
    storage = S3Storage(endpoint_url="http://localhost:4566")

    # Upload
    result = storage.upload("test-bucket", "test.txt", b"Hello World")
    assert result.success is True

    # Download
    data = storage.download("test-bucket", "test.txt")
    assert data == b"Hello World"
```

#### E2E Tests (5% of tests)
- **Slow**: Full workflows
- **Real APIs**: Use test accounts
- **Run**: Manually or in nightly CI

### Test Markers

Use pytest markers to categorize tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.unit          # Unit test
@pytest.mark.integration   # Integration test
@pytest.mark.slow          # Slow test (>5 seconds)
@pytest.mark.gitlab        # Requires GitLab API
@pytest.mark.github        # Requires GitHub API
@pytest.mark.s3            # Requires S3/LocalStack
```

Run specific tests:
```bash
pytest -m unit              # Only unit tests
pytest -m "integration and s3"  # Integration tests for S3
pytest -m "not slow"        # Skip slow tests
```

## Code Quality Standards

### Formatting
- **Black**: Line length 100
- **isort**: Black-compatible profile

```bash
make format  # Auto-format all code
```

### Linting
- **flake8**: Max line length 100
- **pylint**: Enforce best practices

```bash
make lint
```

### Type Checking
- **mypy**: Static type checking

```bash
make type-check
```

### Coverage
- **Minimum**: 80% coverage required
- **Target**: >85% coverage

```bash
make coverage  # Generate HTML coverage report
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

All commits must pass:
- âœ… Black formatting
- âœ… isort import sorting
- âœ… flake8 linting
- âœ… mypy type checking
- âœ… Trailing whitespace removal
- âœ… YAML/JSON validation

## Pull Request Process
